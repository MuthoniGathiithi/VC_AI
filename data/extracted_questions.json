    "question": "6. How to pass your expert system exam.\nIt will be assumed that the ‘knowledge engineers’ are already familiar with the technical\nterminology and jargon associated with the problem domain. You will soon find out how much,\nor little, expert knowledge your ‘experts’ actually have. Think about the goals for your system,\nand the steps that will lead to them. Think about the different outputs your system should be able\nto produce. Clearly, how the Expert System should respond at each stage will depend on many\ndifferent things (such as the age, sex, affluence, tastes, intelligence, skills, mood, etc. of the\nuser), and appropriate rules will need to be built into the system so that it responds appropriately\nto each potential user in each potential situation. The ‘knowledge engineers’ should build up an\nappropriate intermediate representation that their ‘expert’ can help them refine. Think about what\nkind of intermediate representation would be most appropriate for your chosen problem – a\nsemantic network, or decision tree maybe? You should also consider whether your system needs\nto be capable of reasoning with uncertain or fuzzy information, and if so, how in practice you\n\ncould do this. You clearly won’t have time to convert your intermediate representation into a\nfully functional expert system, but you should think about how you would go about doing it if\nyou did have the time. You should aim to consider as many different aspects of Expert System\nbuilding as you can, rather than concentrating on one aspect in detail.",
